// 20: Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.
// Making a Programming Languages Array:
var programmingLanguages = [
    "Typeceipt",
    "JavaScript",
    "Python",
    "PHP",
];
// Print he Message of List:
console.log("List of Programming Languages:");
//Print the Values of Array in the form of List:
programmingLanguages.forEach(function (lang) {
    console.log(lang);
});
